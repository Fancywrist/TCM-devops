This is all the screenshot I have worked with
[200~Linux provides a utility called ps (which stands as abbreviation for ‚ÄúProcess Status‚Äù) for viewing information related with the processes on a system. The ps command is used to list the currently running processes and their PIDs along with some other information, which depends on different options~
